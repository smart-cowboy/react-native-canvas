# React Native Canvas Examples

This project acts as a simple visual regression test for us. It's meant to work
with the latest version of React, React Native, `react-native-canvas`.

## Installation

Navigate to this directory, and run:

```
yarn
```

Once that's done, run:

```
react-native run-ios
```

> This assumes you have the React Native command-line tool installed.

## Usage

If you'd like to contribute to this library, you should check to see that the
examples (on the left of the main view of this app) match the sample images (on
the right). If not, something's probably gone awry.
